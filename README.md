# Installing Angular
Setting everything up wasn't too difficult. I ran a few commands, and it was good to go. 
I did get an error that said something like, "(project name) cannot be loaded because 
running scripts is disabled on this system." I found the fix on Stack Overflow, which 
said I needed to run a script as an administrator to build the project.
The hardest part was definitely hosting it. I used GitHub Pages because it was easy, and I didn't 
want to link my credit card to another website.

# Building this beautiful websites
To build this website, I had to go into the source files. It took me a bit to get used to the overall structure, 
but once I did, it was pretty simple. Then, I went to the app folder and changed the default templates for 
app.component.css and app.component.html. After that, I pushed my changes to GitHub, and that was it.
